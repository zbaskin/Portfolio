2022-03-27,Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022,https://boxd.it/2Hwehn,4.5,,"A multiverse movie not set in the MCU or DCEU. Incredibly innovative in terms of action and multiversal storytelling, but delivers a powerful narrative carried by Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Ke Huy Quan.",,2022-03-26
2022-04-03,Morbius,2022,https://boxd.it/2IDyRj,3,,"Not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Jared Leto gave a solid performance held back by the subpar writing. It’s biggest crime is that it’s forgettable, with no real villain motivation. I’d say it’s on par with Sony’s Venom movies.",,2022-04-02
2022-04-09,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,2022,https://boxd.it/2JKmBV,3.5,,"As enjoyable as the first one, but surpasses it in terms of action and spectacle. Looking forward to the next one.",,2022-04-08
2022-04-16,Ambulance,2022,https://boxd.it/2L0ZZD,3.5,,"Not perfect by any means, especially for the writing, but extremely fun and surprisingly well-paced. The drone shots are amazing and the score accompanies the film well enough to keep me on the edge of my seat.",,2022-04-15
2022-04-22,Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,2022,https://boxd.it/2M8e2J,3.5,,Surprisingly better than I was expecting. Great wizard fight scenes and they didn’t need to waste time on unnecessary setup like the first two. Jude Law nails it as Dumbledore and I hope he returns to the role if they ever remake Harry Potter.,,2022-04-21
2022-04-23,The Northman,2022,https://boxd.it/2Mjr6L,3,,"Has a tremendously promising first act, setting up an extremely compelling retelling of Hamlet with a dash of Nordic flair. The stakes are quickly dashed when the kingdom is traded for a small village. Fate also plays too heavy a hand in the narrative, and it doesn’t feel like Amleth accomplished anything on his own.",,2022-04-22
2022-05-04,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,2022,https://boxd.it/2OeXqV,4,,"A fun, meta love letter to Nick Cage movies and cinema as a whole. I need a time travel, buddy cop movie featuring Nick and CGI de-age-ified Nick.",,2022-05-03
2022-05-06,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022,https://boxd.it/2OzWqn,4.5,,"Visually stunning as always. Literally had me on the edge of my seat, especially with the arrival of the Illuminati. I hope they explore more of that in the future. There are a couple of plot elements I’m still not sure how I feel about, but this is for sure a top-tier Marvel movie. It’s also nice to see Sam Raimi’s directorial flair shine through.",,2022-05-05
2022-05-25,Men,2022,https://boxd.it/2S3Zf5,4,,"The shot composition and color grading were absolutely phenomenal. It was also impressive how different each of Rory Kinnear’s characters felt, he’s hardly recognizable between roles. I feel this movie would pair perfectly with Iron Maiden’s Fear of the Dark. I could have done without the four consecutive male pregnancies, however.",,2022-05-24
2022-06-01,Top Gun: Maverick,2022,https://boxd.it/2TgXb1,4.5,,"The crowning achievement of this movie is its consistency with the original film, especially with the character of Maverick. The dynamic between Maverick and Rooster is extremely compelling and the third act action sequence doesn’t hold anything back in terms of sheer spectacle. The only drawbacks are some confusing editing choices and awkward character introductions. Overall, this movie surpasses the original and makes a strong case for the return to practical effects.",,2022-05-31
2022-06-18,Lightyear,2022,https://boxd.it/2WgmaH,4.5,,"This might be biased considering that Buzz was one of my first favorite characters, but this movie was amazing. The animation quality is Pixar’s best since Incredibles 2 and Giacchino’s soundtrack is exceptional. Seeing how they expanded beyond Buzz’s iconic idiosyncrasies from the Toy Story movies made the movie especially enjoyable. My favorite part of the movie was the inclusion of Zurg, who I’ve always wished to see more. I’m happy with the direction they took this character and hope they can work in Emperor Zurg if they were to develop a sequel.",,2022-06-17
2022-06-19,Power Rangers,2017,https://boxd.it/2Wpv0f,4,Yes,This movie deserved a sequel.,,2022-06-18
2022-06-24,The Black Phone,2021,https://boxd.it/2XpxJZ,3.5,,"I was excited to see this because it’s directed by Scott Derrickson and overall it’s a pretty solid film. Most of child actors give decent performances, except for the main character Finn, which holds the movie back slightly. I thought Gwen was infinitely more interesting of a character and think she should’ve had the lead role. I also wish Ethan Hawke’s character was more developed, but the variations of his mask are interesting enough. The film ends with a satisfying culmination of all the elements set up throughout.",,2022-06-23
2022-06-26,Elvis,2022,https://boxd.it/2XODI9,4,,"I wasn’t expecting much going into this movie, but the editing and pacing are outstanding and really made this super engaging. While I do wish more of the movie had the perspective of Elvis at the forefront, I recognize that this allows the film to forgo the typical clichés of biopics. The second half of the movie really made the movie worthwhile for me.",,2022-06-25
2022-06-28,Paddington 2,2017,https://boxd.it/2YdoZT,4.5,,It made me want to be a better man.,,2022-06-27
2022-06-30,Marcel the Shell with Shoes On,2021,https://boxd.it/2Yz7H3,3.5,,Very competent movie with an interesting premise that didn’t quite resonate with me. There are definitely great jokes and powerful emotional beats. Normally I like the ditzy protagonist but Marcel’s characterization was too inconsistent in my opinion. I appreciate the short runtime because the film uses it well and doesn’t overstay its welcome.,,2022-06-29
2022-07-03,Official Competition,2021,https://boxd.it/2Z4TCx,4,,"Really funny comedy that took me a little while to fully get into - although I’m not sure if that was because of the language barrier or the loud talkers behind me. The ending was really satisfying and the dynamic of the main trio really makes this film unique. In my opinion, Penélope Cruz as Lola is the clear standout of the bunch.",,2022-07-02
2022-07-04,Minions: The Rise of Gru,2022,https://boxd.it/2ZgKUV,3,,"Clearly, this is the best movie Michelle Yeoh has been in for 2022.",,2022-07-03
2022-07-08,Thor: Love and Thunder,2022,https://boxd.it/302TBJ,4.5,,"While I need more time to fully determine this, I think this might be my favorite Thor movie yet. Ragnarok was amazing but it left out some of the most compelling aspects of its source material, namely Planet Hulk. This movie, however, combines the God Butcher and Jane Foster storylines in a much more satisfying manner, while adding really interesting story beats and fight sequences. It wraps up key aspects of the Thor legacy that packs an emotional punch.

Now let’s see Paul Allen’s Necrosword.",,2022-07-07
2022-07-14,RRR,2022,https://boxd.it/31helJ,5,,"This is by far the best movie I’ve seen all year. The hype is real - this movie has it all: the action, the music, the drama. Genuinely can’t wait to watch it again.",,2022-07-13
2022-07-16,The Gray Man,2022,https://boxd.it/31DVat,4,,"This movie is like if The Amazing Race were an espionage thriller. The action is top-notch and it’s great to see that the Russo Brothers can still carry their weight outside of the MCU. My only complaints are that it sometimes takes itself a little too seriously, and that the constant switching between various international locations almost gave me whiplash. I wish Ryan Gosling were less passive of a protagonist, but it was fun to see Chris Evans as a mustache-twirling villain. The Ken doll joke is especially appreciated.",,2022-07-15
2022-07-17,The Deer King,2021,https://boxd.it/31MtJ9,3.5,,"The politics are near incoherent and the some of the plot developments lack a sense of cause-and-effect. Regardless, this movie is visually appealing and the forged father-daughter bond is very touching. Hohsalle’s final revelation about the disease and the epilogue that plays throughout the credits are both satisfying.",,2022-07-16
2022-07-26,Nope,2022,https://boxd.it/33KREL,4.5,,"This is a return to form for Jordan Peele in my opinion. While I need to rewatch both of his other movies, my initial impression of Us was that it was underwhelming compared to his directorial outing in Get Out. This manages to recapture that spark in an exciting thriller. It may have gone over my head (pun intended), but it didn’t seem as though the social commentary was as heavy as his other two movies. My only major gripe about the movie is that there seemed to be some unresolved potential regarding Gordy’s Birthday. Regardless, it was a fun movie with a satisfying final act and an amazing dynamic seen in the brother-sister duo of OJ and Emerald.",,2022-07-25
2022-07-27,Vengeance,2022,https://boxd.it/33YhvL,4.5,,"Didn’t really know much going into it, but delivers surprisingly profound ideas layered into really funny dialogue. This needs to be put right next to King of the Hill in terms of highlighting Texan culture.",,2022-07-26
2022-07-31,DC League of Super-Pets,2022,https://boxd.it/3531y9,4,,"I was going to make this a witty one-liner about how a Guinea pig is down bad for Lex Luthor, but I want to commend how the dialogue is funny and self aware. I was surprised how many curse words this movie was able to drop and the post credits scene goes hard af.",,2022-07-30
2022-08-03,Bullet Train,2022,https://boxd.it/35Idhh,4.5,,Having Thomas the Tank Engine be a major plot element makes it an instant classic no matter what.,,2022-08-02
2022-08-17,Howl's Moving Castle,2004,https://boxd.it/38GJQB,5,Yes,"I’ve seen this movie at least a dozen times, but I think this is the first time it’s made me cry. I’m not sure if it’s because of how incredibly sad I’ve been lately or because I yearn for the connection shared between Howl and Sophie. Regardless, I couldn’t contain my emotion as the final song began to play. I particularly was able to relate to Sophie’s insecurity this viewing, but I will take away the lesson of assuredness and self-love that Sophie is able to learn.

This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. It is not the first Ghibli movie I’ve seen, yet I’ve always been inexplicably drawn to its characters, themes, and world. 

This film is a masterpiece in every sense of the definition. It can be said of cinema in general that every frame is a painting, but it could not be more true in Howl’s. The score masterfully amplifies each emotion intended to convey. I’m fascinated by how the same song can express whimsy, misery, and every emotion in between just by changing the rate at which it is played. Having now seen all of Miyazaki’s works, all of which express anti-war or pro-nature sentiment (or both), none of his films so succinctly and effectively demonstrates the hypocrisy of war. It’s amazing how the plot is driven by the actions of the war, yet all the audience ever sees of the war are its aftereffects. Most importantly, however, the characters are so incredibly constructed I wish I was able to witness their entire lifetimes. I’d especially like to highlight the meticulous attention to Sophie’s aging that teaches me something new about Sophie on every watch. Each voice was cast perfectly, even more so Howl, and the entire found family dynamic between all of the core characters brings me great comfort. 

Everyone has their favorite Ghibli movie, and this one is mine. I will be greatly surprised if another film comes to surpass this one in terms of quality in my eyes throughout my lifetime. ",,2022-08-16
2022-08-20,Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero,2022,https://boxd.it/39egBl,3,,"The action and fight scenes felt like the only redeeming quality of this movie. The amount of plot contrivances and overuse of 3D CGI really hindered this movie. The general plot was passable and it was cool to have Piccolo be such a prominent figure. On the other hand, Gohan has major deadbeat father energy and Bulma’s vanity that was quirky in Broly was extremely cringe. With that being said, this movie does make me want to watch the original series.",,2022-08-19

2022-08-29,Emily the Criminal,2022,https://boxd.it/3aXkwj,4,,"This has a very gripping first act, complete with escalating stakes and realistic consequences. However, this movie loses some steam with a contrived love story. None of the revelations ever truly land on its feet, and I feel that Emily should have faced greater consequences for her actions. Regardless, the resolution is satisfying and the film is very well made overall.",,2022-08-28
2022-09-05,Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul.,2022,https://boxd.it/3cgyUL,3.5,,"There are some interesting ideas this satire explores regarding the superficiality and hypocrisy of megachurches. I thought the character of Trinity was very unique. Some of the scenes dragged on a little too long, however.",,2022-09-04
2022-09-13,Barbarian,2022,https://boxd.it/3dKoXz,4,,"I just thought it was funny to see someone be fearless not for any innate reason, but because they wanted to measure the square footage of their house.",,2022-09-12
2022-09-16,See How They Run,2022,https://boxd.it/3eeLwB,3,,"This movie enjoyed pointing out common murder mystery tropes but didn’t really have any groundbreaking commentary on them. None of the humor really hit for me, and it felt odd not having the crazy cast of characters able to bounce of each other to derive tension.",,2022-09-15
2022-09-18,The Woman King,2022,https://boxd.it/3ezi5N,4,,This movie has a solid narrative and it was nice to have the main perspective be a new recruit so the audience can get acclimated to the warrior culture along with her. Lashana Lynch as Izogie was the standout character for me and I really need to see John Boyega in more movies the next few years.,,2022-09-17

2022-09-19,Pearl,2022,https://boxd.it/3eR4S3,4,,"I wasn’t a huge fan of the first one, so I was only inclined to see this for continuity. I enjoyed it a lot more due to a more tight narrative and distinct stylistic era set during World War I. Regardless, it’s impressive to be able to release an entire trilogy in about two years, and I hope more low-budget movies can capture a mainstream audience like this.",,2022-09-18
2022-09-21,"Goodbye, Don Glees!",2021,https://boxd.it/3fhl39,4,,"Standard coming-of-age story with very clean animation.

2022-09-24,Avatar,2009,https://boxd.it/3fNSoN,5,,"I completely forgot awesome this movie is - it’s been a few years since I’ve seen it. I first experienced this movie when I was nine, so watching it in IMAX 3D was extremely nostalgic. The world of Pandora is absolutely breathtaking and it’s hard to imagine this movie came out in 2009 when it still looks better than a lot of movies that come out today. While the plot is a little simplistic, the themes of environmentalism and anti-imperialism really resonated with me on this watch and Jake’s journey to become one of The People is captivating.",,2022-09-23
2022-09-25,Don't Worry Darling,2022,https://boxd.it/3fYcwx,3.5,,"Honestly this isn’t as bad as I thought it would be based on initial reactions. Miss Flo definitely carries this movie and the ending was amazing. My main issue is that it feels like it conceals information for the sake of making the ending better without giving some sort of compelling alternate theory. I liked a lot of the blink-and-miss psychological distortions but I feel like the best ones were spoiled from the trailer. With that being said, my favorite thing about this movie is that it feels like a movie.",,2022-09-24
2022-09-27,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,2022,https://boxd.it/3grXQn,2.5,,"I saw this as a part of Regal’s Monday Mystery Movie. I didn’t consider this would include streaming releases so I was surprised when this came on. I’m not sure if this is supposed to be a drama or a comedy. It has its moments, but it doesn’t particularly excel at either. My main issue is that there isn’t really any challenge Chickie faces along his journey. This film also has a problem with telling instead of showing. It feels like every other line someone is calling Chickie an idiot, which gets repetitive after a while. Efron’s charisma saves the movie a little along with him seeing the error of his ways by the end.",,2022-09-26
2022-10-01,Smile,2022,https://boxd.it/3hbyOj,4,,"The scariest part of this movie is that it takes place in New Jersey. Normally I find an excessive use of jumpscares to be obnoxious, but the ones in this movie are all executed creatively. A lot of the visuals towards the end are deeply disturbing in a way that makes this horror film better. I really like the themes of mental health and it keeps you guessing if Rose is simply just crazy.",,2022-09-30
2022-10-08,Amsterdam,2022,https://boxd.it/3iDD2z,4,,"If I had a nickel for every time Christian Bale played a squirrelly and socially awkward doctor with a glass eye, I’d have two nickels. This isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.",,2022-10-07
2022-10-09,MK Ultra,2022,https://boxd.it/3iUoSf,2.5,,"The concept is more interesting than the execution. The editing and pacing are all over the place, and the conclusions it comes to are not earned but rather arrive as a result of necessity based on historical reality. The scenes with the patients are the most thought-provoking part but those scenes are too few and far between for a film about a psychological study. Furthermore, this film doesn’t inform or enlighten the viewer on the reality of these events beyond the introduction.",,2022-10-08
2022-10-11,Triangle of Sadness,2022,https://boxd.it/3jqdOl,5,,"One of the best movies I've seen all year. The social commentary is well thought out and it has some genuinely hilarious moments. My favorite aspect is how well the visuals of the movie are conveyed. More so than most movies, I felt this could have been played entirely without sound and I wouldn't have had any issues understanding the themes and story. This is a testament to how well the cinematography, acting, and facial expressions are throughout.",⛵️,2022-10-10
2022-10-15,Till,2022,https://boxd.it/3k89Tf,4,,"Incredibly powerful film with an Oscar worthy performance by Danielle Deadwyler. Between this and Watchmen, she definitely needs to be in more movies.",,2022-10-14
2022-10-15,TÁR,2022,https://boxd.it/3ke4A5,5,,"The girlbossification of Whiplash.

Having barely touched an instrument in my life, I was surprised how much I loved this film. Cate Blanchett delivers an absolutely phenomenal performance as the lead. For being almost three hours long, there is never a dull moment and in that manner the pacing is immaculate. While there are a lot of names and musical terminology that are beyond me, the film does not get dragged down by this and still leaves enough breadcrumbs for the casual viewer to follow along the complexity of the narrative. I'll definitely be giving this a rewatch at some point to find all of the intricate details I missed throughout this first viewing. More so than most, this is a movie I'll be thinking about for a long while after having seen it.",,2022-10-14
2022-10-26,Black Adam,2022,https://boxd.it/3my53z,3,,"Before getting into the review, I just want to say how much I appreciate and admire the Rock’s passion for this character and decade-plus long fight to get this film made. While it doesn’t quite succeed on its initial outing, being carried only by a few good action scenes, it sets up extremely promising encounters for the DCEU. The acting and writing are held back by a seeming lack of direction, with every character being one dimensional or wielding a handful of key expressions. I really hope there is follow through with a showdown between Shazam or Superman, because this movie proves that DC is certainly best at portraying battles of the gods.",,2022-10-25
2022-10-30,Decision to Leave,2022,https://boxd.it/3nioMZ,3.5,,"An incredibly beautiful film with creative shot composition and interesting bits of visual storytelling. I can see why others might rate this higher, but personally I found the scene-to-scene moments to be disjointed and was often slightly confused about what was happening. Furthermore, I felt this movie suffered from being a little too overstuffed, although I’m not sure what could be changed to eliminate this feeling.",,2022-10-29
2022-11-01,Call Jane,2022,https://boxd.it/3nTUUb,4,,Banks and Weaver are an unexpectedly excellent duo I never knew I needed. This film provides timeless snapshots of women’s stories regarding their need for abortion as well as insight into the time period before Roe v Wade.

This movie presents a fresh take on a classic Christmas tale through Reynold's character background of sowing division through good-natured PR and marketing. I was hoping they would lean more into this facet of his character to deliver a powerful meta commentary, but I understand the primary purpose of this is for families to watch during Christmas. It succeeds in this area, even if it ends up being more of the same when it comes to retelling Dickens' story. At least there are some catchy tunes spread throughout.",,2022-11-07

This film soars beyond its predecessor and establishes exciting new status quos for the MCU. Tenoch Huerta absolutely commanded his on-screen presence as Namor and he was my favorite character in the film. Okoye and Ironheart also stood out from the supporting cast for me. Most importantly, Shuri’s elevation to the lead character is not in vain. Her struggle between nobility and vengeance clashes throughout to yield an extremely satisfying conclusion.",,2022-11-10

This film is somewhat of an autobiographical reflection of Iñárritu's struggle with his cultural identity and the dichotomy of his Mexican roots and American acclaim. It's clear there is also influence from his recent success with Birdman and The Revenant (both of which I loved) and how that weighs on him as an artist. The greatest aspect of this film is how a handful of scenes feel like paintings in motion. However, the non-linear storytelling and absurdist imagery was too much for me to handle and I found this movie to be disorienting and hard to follow.

More so than most adaptations, each scene felt like its own chapter and each person was characteristically distinct. The acting and romance between the two leads were compelling, but the editing and scene transitions could have been smoother.

I was expecting to not like this movie or at the very most be ambivalent towards it purely based on the trailer (which I’ve had to see dozens of times in front of other movies the past three months). I really liked seeing the progression of Sam’s film career as a reflection of Spielberg’s own journey. Most surprisingly, this film is quite funny and has some jokes that made me laugh out loud. It inspires me to pick up a pen and camera of my own.",,2022-11-27

Every dialogue scene felt like it was written by aliens that were trying to decipher human speech. All of the characters were written using the same linguistic template and each given a different font. The speaking was fast and snappy, but the actual words made it seem like they were narrating themselves. I kept imagining that the person who wrote this must have read a David Fincher script once and then attempted to recite it from memory.

Every actor gave it their all, complete with layered idiosyncrasies and complex character dynamics; I'm so ready for Hong Chau to start being showered with roles. On that note, Brendan Fraser's performance is absolutely not overrated, as he was able to give me goosebumps and nearly left me in tears. I have to pay attention to this more closely on a rewatch, but the five act structure is also seemingly used to subvert the traditional stages of grief.

A lot can be said on why this movie does not work, but for me the main issue was the total silence from Pooh and Piglet. I can understand the lack of speaking considering these are animals, but there’s not even grunts or groans except for a few squeals from Piglet.

2023-03-08,Creed III,2023,https://boxd.it/3XaR9v,5,,"I’ve been excited but slightly apprehensive about the latest entry to the Creed movies. There were a number of unknown factors at play with this one: Stallone’s contentious departure from the project, Michael B. Jordan’s directorial debut. Most importantly, there is an intentional push away from the Rocky mythos to build on Adonis’s own past and struggles. In my opinion, Creed III delivers the freshest spin on the Rocky formula to date. The fight direction and choreography is the most innovative, and the ending bout might just be my favorite in the franchise. 

While I am forever partial to the Drago legacy, I have to admit that Jonathan Majors as Damian Anderson is the most formidable adversary Creed has ever fought. The rage and ferocity of Clubber Lang is reflected in Anderson, but this time the personal stakes add tremendous significance to the title challenge. Furthermore, the contrasting outfits and color palettes between Creed and Anderson cement the pair as classic literary foils. Without saying how it ends, I really hope to see Majors return as Anderson in a future installment.

A review of one of these movies is not complete without my opinion on the training montage. It didn’t top Rocky IV, but it certainly came close. There are elements of that montage, such as the match cuts between each rival. The music is hype and the feats of strength push the limits as expected, but the callbacks to previous films was surprising. However, there is an unspoken development that manifested during the montage and had me grinning from ear to ear.

When everyone is super, no one is; although in this case when everyone is a bulletproof master of marksmanship and martial arts, the feats of skill lose their shine.

What struck me about this film more than anything were its characters, each one supplementing the narrative in a unique way. Suzume and Souta are great of course, but some of the most memorable characters to me were in the supporting cast and only crossed paths briefly with the protagonists.

2023-05-05,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,2023,https://boxd.it/4cVSov,5,,"Almost ten years ago, James Gunn and Marvel made their largest gamble since Iron Man by choosing to make a film about the no-name heroes known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Today, they are one of the strongest teams in the Marvel lineup. This film completed the Guardians trilogy and made it the most consistently high quality set of movies in the MCU.

Guardians Vol. 3 is an instant S-tier Marvel film for me for one reason: Rocket’s backstory. I knew going into this movie that Rocket’s past would finally be explored in detail even though the previous films have painted a clear enough picture that it would be a gut-wrencher. Every scene with Rocket sent chills down my spine, and a few caused me to shed some tears. None of it was unexpected, but all of it made it the strongest subplot that Marvel has put on screen in my opinion.

The High Evolutionary is also an amazing adversary. I knew from Peacemaker that Chukwudi Iwuji would bring the gravitas necessary to create such an intimidating villain for the Guardians and he did not disappoint.

With Gunn headed to DC, and some of the Guardians having perfectly fitting conclusions to their character arcs, I’m really going to miss this ensemble. It will definitely be remembered as a high point in the Marvel legacy.",,2023-05-04

The scenes that hit, hit fucking hard. The sequence in Nueva York is a masterpiece with an emotional core that is unique and fresh to the existing Spider-Man mythos.

2023-06-13,The Flash,2023,https://boxd.it/4n1Tib,3.5,,"Flashpoint is one of my favorite DC stories, so naturally I had exceedingly high expectations for its first live action adaptation. Unfortunately, this project has incurred some of the worst controversies of a modern blockbuster through its development hell, COVID delays, and whatever is happening with Ezra Miller.

Narratively, this film has all the general story beats of the original comic. While I knew that it wouldn’t involve itself with the Atlantean-Amazon War, I was most disappointed with the exclusion of the Reverse Flash. Not only is he integral to Flashpoint, but he provides compelling reasons for Barry to get involved in the first place. However, through a couple awkward sidesteps and a plot thread that pays off somewhat nicely, I can overlook this with hopes the Reverse Flash will have proper development soon.

I don’t blame you if you can’t, but if you’re able to separate the art from the artist, I think Ezra Miller delivered a decent performance. In my opinion, the aspect that works in his favor is having two Flashes. The double Barry Allen’s paradoxically work because they are able to bounce off each other in a master-apprentice style relationship.

In terms of cameos, this movie has some of the best. While there’s an argument to be had as to how much these cameos degrade the overall quality of the film, there were multiple moments where my jaw went through the floor. Of course, getting to see Keaton’s Batman with the original Elfman theme blaring was magical. Having General Zod effectively mark the beginning and end of this era of the DCEU is also appreciated. However, it was in those unexpected cameos where the movie was made for me.

On a final note, the CGI was noticeably bad, but it’s hard to hold it too much against the movie considering there are multiple extended sequences that require fully CGI shots and content. I will give props to the innovative attempt to depict the traversal of time. While this film doesn’t always look perfect, I can appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.

The Flash is far from a perfect movie, and I imagine this might be conceptually inaccessible to most audiences. To be honest, I had a great time watching and I’m extremely excited for what’s in store for the new era of the DCEU.",,2023-06-12
2023-06-14,Past Lives,2023,https://boxd.it/4nbwp9,4.5,,"Firstly, I want to acknowledge Greta Lee’s phenomenal June double feature: carrying this movie with Yoo Teo and being prominently featured in Across the Spider-Verse. 

This film ultimately portrays the failure of a relationship. The failure isn’t caused by an explosion of emotion or some irreconcilable difference of opinion, but simply a result of cosmic apathy. Nora and Hae Sung’s decade-long connection ties directly to the film’s central theme of <i>inyeon</i> and speaks to the very specific “what-ifs” in love and in life that everyone can relate to on some level or another.

While this unspoken tragedy didn’t quite register with me at my emotional core, it is still a profoundly beautiful film. The aspect that stuck out to me the most is the body language that was able to tell the entire story on its own. I was also captivated by the many shots seeming as though they were taken from the perspective of passing strangers, as if the audience is simply catching a glimpse into the infinitely complex lives of these people.",,2023-06-13

Indiana Jones is one of my favorite film characters of all time, but the mixed reviews of this movie had me quite dismayed. While it was never going to top the originals, Dial of Destiny proves that the formula still works. Every beloved staple of the franchise is found in this film: thrilling chase sequences, ingenious physical comedy, mystical pseudo-religious MacGuffins, and of course Nazi-killing. I appreciated Dr. Voller’s desire is not driven by pure greed but rather physical and mathematical theories to the point where he uses Hitler’s Reich as a means to an end. The final set piece of the film was the highlight for me, it made sense for a character obsessed with ancient history to find himself able to transcend that barrier in his golden hour. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones will forever be remembered as a landmark character in cinema and I really hope this franchise is able to continue in some way without him (fingers crossed for a Short Round spin-off).",,2023-07-04

2023-07-11,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning,2023,https://boxd.it/4v74x9,5,,"One of my first college experiences was attempting to make friends with my floormates by attending a weekend get-together and movie night. I don’t remember how it was chosen, it probably had to do with the fact Fallout had just released, but the movie of choice was the original Mission Impossible, a film and franchise I knew about but didn’t give much attention. Dead Reckoning is my first theatrical experience with this franchise and by now I can say that it is one of my favorite series of films ever made. I’m continually amazed in how each film is able to rival or surpass its predecessor, and this entry is no exception.

Dead Reckoning sheds the emotional intimacy of the previous films in favor of drastically increasing the threat contained within. Artificial intelligence has been a hot topic since at least the original film, but there couldn’t have been a better time to capture the zeitgeist of the charged climate regarding it the way this film did. This franchise already has its share of memorable villains, but in my opinion The Entity is the most intimidating one yet. At the very least, the concept of a “stateless, amoral, and areligious” entity as is stated in the film is entirely in line with raising the stakes as each film in the franchise has managed to accomplish. Furthermore, previous villains have touted that they are multiple steps ahead of Ethan. This is the first that instills the nightmare that the enemy can not only know your next move but also change the very foundation of truth as is shown multiple times throughout the movie.

Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff are some of my favorite additions to the franchise. Hayley’s character Grace subverts the traditional enemy-to-ally trope by infusing it with a shared sense of camaraderie that is unique to Ethan’s team. On the other hand, I was initially disappointed with Pom’s lack of dialogue, but quickly grew to love the physicality she imbued into her performance.

While nothing needs to be added about Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, I’ll just say that he is one of the main reasons I have grown in love with this franchise. His passion for the character and the filmmaking is palpable and appreciated.

On a final note, I want to note how well this film manages to incorporate mind games and puzzles as well as its action set pieces. Some of my favorite sequences didn’t involve any fighting but rather required a solution that needed to be outsmarted, such as the Abu Dhabi airport or Italian gala scenes. Additionally, what provided the most tension throughout the film was how there were almost always four or five parties involved that all had conflicting goals and motives.

I think I might appreciate Fallout just a tiny bit more, but Dead Reckoning is a masterclass in tension and raising the already impossible stakes that the previous entries have set.",,2023-07-10

Margot Robbie serves an Oscar-worthy performance, Ryan Gosling gives an expected “literally me” characterization of Ken, and America Ferrera is the standout star of the film for me. An incredibly meta comedy that really makes you think about what it means to be human. The first half of Barbenheimer will be fondly remembered for years to come.",,2023-07-20
2023-07-21,Oppenheimer,2023,https://boxd.it/4yfD4T,5,,"From the very first shot, Nolan frames this film not as a traditional biopic - he never settles for traditional - but rather an American epic with a tale as tall as Prometheus. Clocking in at three hours, Nolan sheds the humble beginnings of an at the time unrecognized genius that would normally be the focus of the film. 

After a fascinating sequence that I can only liken to seeing the Avengers of twentieth century physicists and mathematicians, we are hurried along to the selling point of the film: the creation of the atomic bomb. There is never a dull moment as Oppenheimer leads the Manhattan Project to its terminus. The Trinity Test scene might be the best of Nolan’s career. However, after this point the film spends little time pontificating over the moral quandaries of the bomb as was expected. 

The final hour brings together all the remaining plot threads into a very fast-paced yet exhilarating thesis on the nature of scientific credibility specifically with regards to Lewis Strauss. In a broad sense, this feud can be compared to the Batman and Joker of Nolan’s filmography. Between Oppenheimer and Strauss lies an irreconcilable difference of opinion regarding the future of atomic energy. The final line of the film is quite haunting in this regard.

If we piece this film into the rest of Nolan’s work, it’s association with respect to the motif of time and Homeric protagonists is clearly established. I simply want to compare this film to Dunkirk, as this is Nolan’s second film explicitly exploring World War II. Dunkirk, from the perspective of the British, is a microcosm of British perseverance against the German war machine. Oppenheimer is a highlight reel of the events and aftermath regarding the creation of the bomb. In both instances, the enemy abroad is never shown in any meaningful capacity, yet disunity and disloyalty at home is among the chief introspections in both films. In Oppenheimer’s case, however, the unique history of post-war America and the Red Scare lends itself to play much more heavily into this theme.

On a final note, the secondary elements of the film from the soundtrack to the use of color to the supporting cast are all phenomenal. Ludwig Goransson is officially one of the best living composers with this score in my eyes, with some of the tracks rivaling that of even Zimmer’s best. I really loved the use of black and white to depict fact as opposed to the colorful feeling and slight hyperbole of the rest of the film. Specifically, the overexposed shots that correlated to extreme emotions was appreciated.

The second half of Barbenheimer surpassed my anticipation, but as both a history buff and Nolan fan that was to be expected.",,2023-07-20

While the difference in quality wasn’t visible to my eye, I could tell by the nature of the larger screen and reduced margins that there was an inherent increase in visual fidelity. 

This time around, I wanted to highlight a striking parallel I noticed between a painting Oppenheimer sees during his European studies and his sullen face upon witnessing the atrocities of the bombs. It can’t be overstated how terrifyingly powerful the ending of this film is, and on this viewing it made me observant of the motif of raindrops throughout the film that I’ll have to pay more attention to on my next watch.",,2023-08-04

The turtles are the most “teenage” they’ve ever been and are now firmly in the zoomer demographic while still retaining some of their nineties charm. Donatello is my favorite in this with his Attack on Titan game plan, Jojo’s sweater, and Gojo staff sticker. The art style is certainly inspired by Spider-Verse, but is personalized enough to create a distinct vibe and atmosphere. The referential humor, while appreciated, sometimes felt out of place or forced. Additionally, some of the plot and character arcs didn’t feel particularly paced well. Overall though, this is the most enjoyable Turtles movie I’ve seen and I’m excited for a potential sequel.",,2023-08-07

Instead of going wild with this concept, this film mainly revolves around industrial sabotage and surface-level messaging about saving the oceans, with megalodons simply being an inconvenience to the crew. It would be awesome if this expanded on the last movie by adding lore to the trench, such as having trench warfare between sharks or even something absurd like a sect of creatures that have managed to live for millions of years. Despite all the negatives, this movie is actually somewhat entertaining, which is a testament to how great this franchise could be with interesting writing.",,2023-08-08
2023-08-13,Gran Turismo,2023,https://boxd.it/4GDy29,4,,"My first impression is that this is just feature-length advertisement for Nissan and PlayStation, and there are some moments in this film where that feels like the point. I wish there was more introspection as to the why and the how of the GT Academy’s inception, although I admit that would be better suited for a documentary. I also felt that Jann’s path to success was very superfluous, as if he was destined to win simply because that’s the outcome that happened in real life; there weren’t many obstacles he had to overcome that were patently within his control.

As an advertisement for racing as a sport, however, this film is certainly persuasive. To Neill Blomkamp’s credit, the direction of the racing scenes is pure electricity, especially with the musical score. I didn’t expect much from this film going in, but I’m glad that I gave it a chance. Either way, I’m just grateful I won’t have to see that awful trailer before other movies anymore.",,2023-08-12

2023-08-19,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,2014,https://boxd.it/4IxxML,5,Yes,"I don’t care what anyone else says, this is STILL my favorite Spider-Man movie. 

I’ve always been into superheroes, but this is the movie that inspired me to go out the next day to my local comic shop. From there, I saw and picked up Amazing Spider-Man #1 (2014) which started fresh after the conclusion of the Superior Spider-Man saga (and likely re-numbered to capitalize on the release of this film). This film ignited my love of comics and throughout high school I collected weekly. In a sense, this movie helped me become the man I am today.

Beyond personal sentiment, I genuinely love every aspect of this iteration of Spider-Man. This is, in my opinion, the best live-action suit in the Spider-Man filmography and arguably one of the best suits of any superhero movie. I also find the chemistry between Andrew and Emma to be the most engaging of any romantic pairing in any superhero film. On top of that, the action and score (shout out to The Electro Suite) are top-notch. I also feel that this movie captures the “friendly neighborhood” aspect of Spider-Man the most, as there are many scenes throughout designed around saving and comforting the people of New York.

While there will likely be more Spider-Man films that best this in terms of quality, I’m not sure if any of them will be able to dethrone this one in my eyes as a personal favorite.",,2023-08-18

This film is extremely generic as far as origin stories go, but it was still a necessary addition to the existing DC film canon. The commentary on gentrification and ‘Kickstart My Heart’ needle drop were greatly appreciated and the resolution to Jaime’s fight with Carapax hit unexpectedly hard.

I’ve always been fond of this film’s ironically more grounded perspective in chronicling Jiro Horikoshi’s life as well as the history of early twentieth century Japan. On this viewing, I became more aware of the true mastery that Hayao Miyazaki displays, as this is the pinnacle of his decades-long career. The sprawling cityscapes with hundreds of moving people, as well as the beautiful vistas and dedication to the majesty of aviation.

I was able to follow along enough, but was left confused by multiple decisions and skirmishes (and an awkward bird metaphor). I also wish the referenced maps were more deliberate in highlighting key events, as they could have been a useful tool to relay information to the audience.

I really like Kenneth Branagh both as an actor and as a director—he’s one of the few people I would consider a classical thespian—and I’d gladly take a hundred more of these mysteries.

The last twenty minutes contains multiple points that felt natural for the film to end, but it just kept going. I’ve also never been this morally confused.

2023-09-29,The Creator,2023,https://boxd.it/4UFZ3t,4,,"Visually one of the best movies of the year, with awesome robot designs and futuristic tech. This film’s likeness to Star Wars is overwhelming, not just because of Gareth Edward’s previous film, but I could imagine the pitch for this being “Star Wars in real life.” The allegory for the Vietnam War, parallels to U.S. imperialism, Force-wielding Chosen Ones, and a nomadic Death Star are a few of the most prominent connections. Regardless, this film sets forth unique ideas about artificial intelligence, and it’s refreshing to see a big budget sci-fi movie get made that isn’t connected to an existing intellectual property.

Emotionally this film is a bit dry and it especially lacks surprise. After a gripping first scene, it takes a while for the suspense to build back up to a meaningful status quo. Despite this, there are many aspects about this world that fascinated me. The cross-section between robots and religion is rarely explored and one that this film tackles head on. The particular way society has developed with artificial intelligence, and the established historical timeline related to that, is stimulating as much as it is enthralling. These topics make this film a worthwhile viewing experience for any admirer of science fiction. Not to mention the many pieces of world building that added to the overall enjoyment for me, such as the ability to briefly reanimate the dead or the unstoppable blitzkrieg of a bomb droid.",,2023-09-28

The team-up of Carol, Monica, and Kamala is one that I’ve been anticipating since the Ms. Marvel show aired (which has remained among my favorites of the MCU shows). While the villain is objectively kind of a nothing burger, all I could have asked for was to see the group dynamics play out. The relationship between Carol and Monica and the mentorship between Carol and Kamala are extremely compelling and stand out when compared to the rest of the Marvel Universe. In that regard, I almost feel like the runtime could have been even longer because I had a big smile for most of the movie.

I’m a bit conflicted on this one, but it’s possible it just needs more time to simmer in my mind. There are a lot of aspects I loved about this movie: the raw, visceral feeling of the actual Hunger Games, the symbolic allusions to various iconic moments of the core series, and the gradual build up of Snow as the tyrant he is meant to become. 

However, the aspect I was looking forward to the most was the connection between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray, and I’m not sure I’m fully satisfied with its development. For the record, Rachel Zegler is an absolute star in this film. Despite this, I never truly felt that their romantic connection was worth all of the trouble and bloodshed it would sow.

It’s safe to say that my fears were unfounded as this cements itself not just as a holiday classic, but as an exploration of interpersonal and familial connection. Paul Giamatti is unsurprisingly brilliant, but Dominic Sessa was the surprise standout for me in this film, especially considering this is his acting debut.

2023-11-23,Napoleon,2023,https://boxd.it/5cOvzT,3,,"I wanted so much to love this movie, but it suffers from the sheer amount of history it attempts to cover. Somehow this film is simultaneously too short and too long; too short because it doesn’t give each event the necessary time to breathe and develop, but too long because it compiles too many of these events without a significant thematic throughline. It’s clear his relationship with Josephine is the central factor, but it oftentimes feels like an afterthought. 

There are still plenty of aspects I liked about this film. It goes without saying that Joaquin’s performance is among the best of the year. He adds nuance that allows the petulance and insecurity of Napoleon to shine through. Furthermore, the battle recreations are some of the most captivating scenes in the entire movie and the strategic moves are well telegraphed. My favorite part about this movie is how well shot it is—many frames from this film can easily be transformed into majestic paintings and vistas.

The rating I give this film is not necessarily reflective of its quality. Rather, this review serves as an honorary badge acknowledging the breadth and totality of Hayao Miyazaki's life work, distilled into one film. The thematic threads of Miyazaki's comprehensive filmography are masterfully woven together to produce this narrative; the energies of Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle pierced through the folds most especially. 

My only complaint regarding this film is that it lacks a sense of urgency. The first act took its time in introducing the characters and the world. However, once the narrative shifts into the second act, that same build up is required to develop the strange new world Mahito finds himself. While the culmination of this exposition is more than worthwhile, the time spent nurturing it does not pass by unnoticed.

This review would be remiss not to acknowledge the legendary performances from the entire cast, but especially from Robert Pattinson. I am not exaggerating when I say that it might be one of the most impressive vocal performances I have ever heard put to film. Not only is The Grey Heron a massive deviation from his existing body of work, but the range that Pattinson displays in this role is absolutely extraordinary.

It will remain to be seen if this is truly Miyazaki's last film, but if his filmography were to cease with this—well, that might just be alright with me.",,2023-12-08

2023-12-20,Concrete Utopia,2023,https://boxd.it/5mjf5r,4.5,,"Concrete Utopia is a fascinating study of the responsibility we owe to our fellow man, especially in a crisis. The beginning of the film postures itself as a typical disaster scenario, but it’s when the dust settles that true chaos begins to unfold. The hysteria of the masses are quickly radicalized into an authoritarian nightmare.

Lee Byung-hun has remained a favorite of mine since I first saw him in Joint Security Area. His performance as Yeong-tak is one of the most dynamic I’ve seen from him; his friendly demeanor is able to be quickly transformed into a frightening aura. In relation to Yeong-tak, I want to point out two shots that stood out to me. The first being a hilarious visual gag regarding cannibalistic raiders, and the second being a haunting zoom-out of shadows dancing amongst the spoils of war.

The recurring motif of cockroaches is tremendously poignant. We first see literal cockroaches swarm out when prodded. However, shortly after the outsiders are ostracized as cockroaches, as well as anyone that harbors them. Ironically, the apartment dwellers are not exempt from that same label, as they scavenge for food and crawl through rubble. 

On a final note, I appreciated the twisting of a bleak film into a ray of hope. By highlighting the futility of violence, the survivors prove that even at the ends of the earth can we still find humanity.",,2023-12-19

2024-04-14,Take Care of My Cat,2001,https://boxd.it/6gVFNT,4.5,,"I have been trying to watch this movie for well over a year. I found it last year through a couple of “Top 50” or “Top 100” lists when I was doing my Korean cinema binge, but the sheer inaccessibility of the title made me more determined to watch it as you will soon find out. For months it was completely unavailable on any streaming service, so I figured I would try to pirate it or rip it online. To my surprise I couldn’t find it anywhere, nor could I find anyone else that seemed remotely interested in trying to access it. 

By the time I went to visit Korea, I still couldn’t watch it, but I found solace when I learned it was readily available on Korean Netflix. After a couple days of non-stop activity, I took a lazy morning to rest up. I boot up Netflix, only to find that there were no English subtitles. After some more attempts to find it when I returned home, I eventually stopped trying.

A couple of months ago, when looking for another title, I noticed this film was suddenly available on a streaming service called Hoopla for libraries. At first I thought there was no big deal, since I have an active library membership. However, it turns out that my library is not in the network that has access to Hoopla. No worries, I’ll just get a membership to an in-network library. I go to a library a town or so over and try to sign up only to be told I can’t because I am not a resident of that town. I go to my library to see how I can gain access only to be told that it won’t be possible since we pay for access to a similar app called Kanopy. It should be noted that I would gladly pay for access if I could, but there is literally no way to sign up for Hoopla without some form of an in-network library membership. In essence, I can’t pay to watch this film, I can’t sign up for a different library because I don’t live there, and I can’t get access through my library because we have access to a competitor’s application.

There was one last glimmer of hope that I found before I would give up for good. Clifton is a town that’s about thirty minutes away on a good day. In what I assume is a policy implemented during Covid to get more people using the library, they allow you to sign up for a free trial to Hoopla without any membership or verification. Thinking I had outsmarted the system, I was disappointed to find that it was able to verify whether or not I was actually in Clifton and prevented me from signing up, even when I manipulated the website’s metadata. A couple days ago, I made the trek to this Clifton library, connected to the WiFi, and went to make an account. I nervously went through the signup process, knowing that the result would make or break my ability to watch this film. A wave of relief washed over me when I was faced with a successful account creation screen. At long last, my odyssey was completed.

After all this yapping, how was the actual film? 

The study of Take Care of My Cat is that of a friend group in decay. This film revolves around a group of five young women that were close in high school but now are starting their adult lives and consequently drifting apart. We are not shown any of the past or moments where these friends are truly carefree and frictionless. Rather, this film is a collection of minor schisms that form within their friend group.

Admittedly, this film is more bleak than I was anticipating. For some reason I imagined this film as capturing one last hurrah of friends before they start their careers and therefore have less free time to spend time together. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the end result. Coincidentally, I’m at the point of my life where I am most able to relate to this film. I’ve just finished school and started my adult life, which will become the norm for the next couple of decades. I may not be experiencing the same malaise that is depicted in this film, but there are certainly some moods and actions that which I can wholeheartedly relate. 

As an aside, I also want to highlight the use of technology within the film. For being released in 2001, it feels like one of the first films that has captured the increasingly digital generation and how young people interact with their phones. Text message conversations are overlaid the physical environment inhabited by their author, a technique which is the modern day standard for any teen, young adult, and coming-of-age story.

Overall, this film perfects the slice-of-life narrative and at times makes you feel like you are the sixth member of the friend group. I wish it was more easily accessible, so that more people can experience this film for themselves.",,2024-04-12

There are definitely great ideas developed by this film, but unfortunately they are too fragmented and ultimately overshadowed by ideas with which I disagree.

As the opportunistic vultures of capitalism progressively sink their claws into the landscape, they find that nature has a way of retaliating. I especially love the open-ended nature of the ending as it represents at least three different interpretations that all significantly contribute to each of the themes woven throughout this film.",,2024-05-19

As time passed, I became increasingly doubtful that this story was worth telling. Furiosa takes its foot off the gas pedal in comparison to Fury Road, but what this film loses in pure adrenaline it more than makes up for in character. It’s equally as satisfying to witness Furiosa grow to become the Imperator as it is seeing the intertribal conflict unfold across the wasteland. Similarly, Dementus introduces a unique fold to both Furiosa’s characterization and the world at large—I really enjoyed the dynamic between Dementus and Immortan Joe. The synergy this film has with Fury Road is unreal, and I’d love a supercut of both films. Where Fury Road was a religious experience, this film is undoubtedly a sermon of righteous fury.",,2024-05-24

I worked at an AMC in high school during its peak around 2017-2018 and also witnessed its downfall. Every other shift there would be a guest whose MoviePass wasn’t working, people strewn throughout the lobby unsuccessfully attempting to get through to their customer service over the phone. But I was also there when the management of AMC gathered us to unveil their new A-List subscription for the first time. While everyone knew MoviePass’s subscription model was unsustainable, it innovated the moviegoing experience as it currently stands where every distributor has their own subscription service.

Much of the content of this film I got to hear firsthand last year when I met Stacy Spikes at his book signing. This documentary is informative of the overall journey of MoviePass as it shines a light on the executives that brought it down from the inside.

2024-06-11,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,https://boxd.it/6EBmT5,5,Yes,"This is the best Star Wars movie, and I’m tired of pretending that it’s not. 

One of the biggest hot takes I have is when I tell people this is my favorite Star Wars film. The strongest aspect of The Last Jedi is its ability to take risks and commit to ideas that are unconventional in comparison to the rest of the mythos. Rey lacking a connection to an established bloodline; Luke cutting himself off from the Force; Kylo Ren betraying Snoke to become the new Supreme Leader. These are just few points of contention among fans I’ve seen discussed in the years since this film released. Even if you disagree with these narrative threads, it is undeniable that there is a concerted effort to launch Star Wars in a bold new direction. Had the final entry of the trilogy followed through on the foundation set by this film, and not balked by unraveling many of its decisions, The Last Jedi would be hailed as a visionary first step to modernize a franchise that insists on getting high on the drug of nostalgia.

A while ago I committed to rewatching all of the X-Men films—not because it’s necessary, but because this franchise is truly special to me and it’s been a long time since I’ve seen some of these. A lot of people look towards Spider-Man for defining the modern superhero theatrical experience, but in my eyes this was the first film that set the golden standard for the genre. 

The legacy of this franchise is nothing if not flawed, destined to die through its pitiful last breath that was The New Mutants (until reacquired by Disney). The quality of each film is inconsistent with people at the helm that didn't fully understand these characters. However, for each dud there was a true diamond in the rough, and the overall cast of both generations is near perfection. I want to highlight this movie for giving us Hugh Jackman. He was almost certainly destined for greatness—especially in the realm of theater—but if you look at his filmography, X-Men was his first big break.

There are a dozen films left to watch in this series, meaning I have to watch one every two or three days. I’m looking forward to see how these compare to each other given the length of time I’ve gone without seeing some of them. All I can say for certain is that Days of Future Past is my favorite (and it’s not even close).",,2024-06-21

Luckily this year is this film’s seventieth anniversary, and a shiny 4K remaster is playing in theaters to celebrate. The framing and cinematography is the real winner here. Having never seen this before, I was struck by how much care was put into each shot and frame. The accompanying score is also a stand out for me. 

The greatest feat of this film is demonstrating the weight of each decision. Meticulous surveying and planning leads to each bandit being accounted for on screen. Ironically, my only gripe with this film is that there wasn’t any sound effects for the sword hits, causing the action to feel less weighty.

2024-07-27,Deadpool & Wolverine,2024,https://boxd.it/6Y2yur,5,,"There’s certainly some bias in this rating since I’ve just spent the last month watching every X-Men movie. This universe has been around with me literally since I was born, with the first X-Men film releasing a month beforehand. Eventually my love would be overtaken by the burgeoning MCU, but the Fox Universe greatly contributed to the early development of my passion for superheroes. In my teens my disdain for the Fox Universe grew in equivalency to the rise in popularity of the MCU. The more I learned about the comic wars and Marvel’s bankruptcy led me to believe that these characters deserved to be in the rightful hands of Marvel Studios. Every success of the Avengers had me criticizing every failure of the disjointed X-Men.

Fast forward a decade and Marvel now has near complete control of its intellectual property. They’re taking a fastidious approach in reintroducing us to fan-favorite characters and integrating them into the MCU. While the past couple of years have given us hints of mutants in the MCU, we’ve never been given a chance to properly grieve the death of what was once the most prominent superhero franchise put to film. The New Mutants released unceremoniously in theaters at the height of Covid after years of delays, and the last mainline X-Men film Dark Phoenix was a critical and financial bomb over five years ago. While I’m glad mutants are finally in the MCU, I can’t help but mourn the loss of a universe that had such a unique tone and character compared to its contemporary counterparts (even if they were often deeply flawed).

Deadpool & Wolverine was promoted as being Deadpool’s first foray into the MCU, the long awaited team-up of both eponymous characters being the central selling point. About a week or so before this film’s release, a special screening of this movie was advertised for San Diego Comic Con titled “Celebration of Life.” Rather than being the MCU’s first Deadpool movie, this film is ultimately a celebration of life for the Fox Universe. Without spoiling, this film eulogizes and honors every Fox-Marvel film that came before it—not just the X-Men but every single one of its properties from the late nineties to now. This is cemented by a touching end-credits montage that contains almost twenty-five years of behind-the-scenes footage.

This film is definitely sustained by its references and cameos in a similar fashion to No Way Home, with more emphasis on the metatextual humor given that it’s a Deadpool movie. At its core, the narrative and emotional aspects of this film are not very strong. Despite being the MCU’s first R-rated movie, it still feels like there is a layer of sanitization when compared to the previous entries in the trilogy. Regardless, the presence of Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine gave me everything I could want out of this film. I had accepted the fact we would never see him in the role again after Logan. Rewatching both previous Deadpool movies made me realize how necessary this pairing was; the amount of jokes at Wolverine’s expense makes this film slide effortlessly into the trilogy, despite being made by separate production companies and in different eras.

Deadpool & Wolverine lived up to my expectations, delivered unexpected cameos, and served as the greatest possible swan song to the Fox Universe. The MCU is so back, let’s fucking go.",,2024-07-25

2025-02-15,Captain America: Brave New World,2025,https://boxd.it/8PGV1x,4,,"It’s been six years since Endgame, and we finally get to see Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson shine as Captain America. To prepare for this, I watched all of the Captain America films (Civil War twice!), Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and The Incredible Hulk over the past month. I should also add that Captain America—whether helmed by Steve Rogers or Sam Wilson—is my favorite character currently in the MCU. Before getting into the comics, my preconceived notion of Captain America was that he was a goody-two-shoes government drone. Imagine my surprise upon first reading Civil War and learning that Captain America defies his country and becomes a fugitive of the state. Captain America stands not for what America is, but what our nation strives to be. 

Over the last eleven years, we get to see Sam Wilson grow as a friend of Steve Rogers and come into his own as both a hero and now leader of the Avengers. The strongest aspect of Sam Wilson’s debut as the leading man of his own movie is that it manages to carry the weight of the legacy of Captain America in my eyes. There are certainly some missteps in this first outing, but there is nothing that indicates to me that Sam Wilson (or Anthony Mackie for that matter) is incapable of carrying the shield. This is emphasized by Sam’s devotion to exonerating Isaiah Bradley throughout this film. After getting to know him in Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Bradley is the physical manifestation of the evils perpetrated by our government and our country. Although choosing to work with that very same government, Sam Wilson is able to challenge the evils that forged Bradley and dispel them from within.

There is no beating around the bush: this film is effectively a direct sequel to The Incredible Hulk. Many people are chastising this film for being so, but I genuinely think this aspect works in its favor. I understand that the original film isn’t exactly held in high regard the same way Iron Man is, but, as the second film in the nascent MCU, it proved to audiences that these films were interconnected in a way that had never been done before. If you go looking, there are so many callbacks to show reverence to The Incredible Hulk beyond just using Thaddeus Ross and Samuel Sterns within the plot, such as the “Mr. Blue” song or the sonic cannons that incapacitate the Hulk in the original film. The idea that the MCU could still iterate over its earliest roots strengthened this film for me.

Unfortunately, the two central antagonists seen in Leader and Red Hulk aren’t utilized as effectively as they could be. I was probably one of five people that was genuinely excited to see the return of Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns after almost seventeen years. My main problem with his characterization in this film is that he is, in essence, a worse Baron Zemo. Both characters are defined by their lack of physical prowess but, as a regular person, Zemo’s master plan left an impact in the universe whose effects are still felt to this day. Samuel Sterns has a mind enhanced by gamma radiation, but his plan won’t even be remembered by the next film. His case is not improved by the writers failing to demonstrate his full capability and instead diluting his plan to a poorly explained power of probability. Red Hulk, on the other hand, is great. However, it’s hard not to imagine that his inclusion would have been more powerful if it wasn’t advertised beforehand. Similarly, Harrison Ford delivers a fine performance as Thaddeus Ross. It’s just sad that William Hurt wasn’t able to be a leading antagonist once again as he played a perfect Ross that should be likened to J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. 

The action set pieces lived up to the standard set by the other Captain America films. The highlight for me was the skirmish at what we now know is Celestial Island. The payoff to this plot thread from Eternals that people have been clamoring for years was well worth the time it took to address it properly. The sociopolitical messaging throughout the movie is ironically a bit hollow compared to earlier films, but in regards to Celestial Island I felt the tension between nations was spot on. It would be natural for there to be a power grab over a new resource and for war to almost break out because of it. I do think the adamantium could have been used more efficiently by demonstrating a use case for it rather than just using it as a plot vehicle, but I have some ideas of where they can go with it. Going back to how this set piece is used within the film, I really enjoyed it because of its differentiation with the other Captain America films. This is a scene that could only happen with Sam Wilson as Captain America, empowered by the high-speed flight of his Falcon wings in a similar fashion to Top Gun. The two stand out moments were Redwing maneuvering the shield between a hail of gunfire and Sam surfing on a missile. The action in this film made me hopeful of future encounters where Sam is able to bounce off of other flight-enabled characters, whether they’re friend or foe.

On a final note, this film doesn’t quite live up to its predecessors but, as this film highlights, it’s also not fair to fully compare Sam Wilson to Steve Rogers. Sam Wilson demonstrates in this movie that he is his own man, hero, and leader. While they share the same mantle, by the time the next Avengers film rolls around, this film proves that Sam Wilson is ready to embark upon a brave new world.",,2025-02-13

The pacing specifically was a little hard to swallow, especially during the second act, and I was expecting the idea of cloning to be explored further. I know that Bong Joon-ho likes to make films with themes of capitalism and corruption, but the way those themes were presented in this film felt too much like Snowpiercer; it doesn't help that both movies take place in frozen hellscapes. On a positive note, I loved Robert Pattinson’s performance. I really think he deserves an Oscar at some point because the range he’s displayed across his entire filmography is truly astounding.

I put this on my list due to the positive early buzz at Sundance in 2023, for a film starring what was my favorite up-and-coming actor at the time. Of course, I find Jonathan Majors’ actions reprehensible and no longer feel comfortable supporting him. At the same time, I genuinely believe his work to be generational, and this film is no exception. Jonathan Majors will unfortunately always be one of Hollywood’s biggest “what ifs” in my mind.

The film itself feels derivative of a lot of other films of the past decade. I’ve seen comparisons to Whiplash or Joker—which are warranted—but I thought this film mostly resembled a modern day American Psycho. I thought the film worked best when it focused on the bodybuilding. Thematically, the internal need for validation fuels the drive to push one’s body past its limit, which can and does lead to dangerous consequences. The second half of the film loses me when its focus pulls away from Killian’s bodybuilding. There simply aren’t that many films I can think of that utilizes this sport to highlight its themes and message besides last year’s Love Lies Bleeding.

2025-03-30,Nightcrawler,2014,https://boxd.it/9ghhyT,5,Yes,"Last night I had the opportunity to see the Broadway adaptation of Othello with Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. They’re both two of my favorite actors, but especially Gyllenhaal since seeing this film in theaters over ten years ago. The play was set in the near future, trading the Venetian plate armor and robes for uniforms similar to the American military. Despite the modern sensibilities, the dialogue is all from the original play with Shakespearean English. While hard to follow at times, the acting is so good it helped me understand what was happening and how each scene fit into the play as a whole. Since graduating high school, I’ve grown to appreciate many of Shakespeare’s works and getting to see them acted out on stage has changed how I see these plays.

The entire supporting cast was great, and Emilia and Rodrigo were the standouts for me. As expected, Denzel and Gyllenhaal are on another level. For both of them, it seems as though acting comes as easily to them as breathing, and it was a privilege getting to see them act in person. Gyllenhaal’s multiple asides and monologues were the highlight of the play for me. To end the night, I was able to thank Jake Gyllenhaal for his performance and even got him to sign my Playbill. I will be thinking about this performance for years to come.",,2025-03-29

The only part of this movie I consistently enjoyed was The Sentry, whose inclusion was handled well and demonstrated his powers effectively. I felt the themes of mental health, while a nice inclusion, were executed heavy handedly and explored much better in Jake Schreier's previous work, Beef. This movie also frustrated me from an overall plot perspective. It took Sentry only a day or two to be fully trained? How does Valentina have access to all of these vast resources when she is under intense scrutiny from the government?

I liked the cast of characters, but considering their fate at the end of this movie, it was hard to be too attached to them. Then, after almost everyone had moved past this film, they announced an Andor show. I thought “Really, they couldn’t think of anything better to make content out of?” the same way I did when they announced a movie about how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans.

Clearly, I’m not a great at judging a book by its cover, because Andor is definitively the best Star Wars show to date. They’ve taken what whom originally felt like a Han Solo knockoff and turned Cassian Andor into a charged vessel for the political unrest of the era. This movie already does a great job highlighting how miraculous the Rebel victory is in A New Hope, but now knowing more about the five years of scheming leading up to this film uplifts and adds weight to the events that take place.

2025-05-25,Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,2025,https://boxd.it/9MR8lL,5,,"The final banger. This movie loses any sense of being grounded in reality that the earlier films had. This movie ups the ante to the most impossible levels, but it’s just so entertaining that it doesn’t really matter. As a fan of the franchise, this movie is a perfect ending, tying in details from every other film preceding it. It also serves as an amazing ending for Ethan Hunt (whom I learned I share a birthday with during this watch), although I know Tom Cruise will want to keep it going in some way. 

The only thing this film is missing is a cohesive team shouting in Ethan’s ear while he’s performing his stunts. It makes sense given the context of both the film and the stunts themselves. However, without the active communication aspect that is critical to the essence of these films, it makes this movie just slightly hollow compared to the rest.

There’s a lot more that can be said about this film, and especially how the action always raises the bar for the rest of the industry. This review would not be complete without honoring the backbone of these films: Luther Stickell.

My goal is to watch every live-action Superman film, and as many Superman-adjacent animated movies as I can before then. 

I used to not fully appreciate this character. As I got into comics, I read a few starter graphic novels like Kingdom Come and Red Son. I liked what I was reading, but there wasn’t enough gravity pulling me towards more in the same way as Batman. It didn’t help that there wasn’t any great mainstream Superman media at the time and I was left with the impression that he was simply a boring character. 

My dad showed me this movie around the same time I was getting into comics. I liked it, but wasn’t impressed with the visual effects as they compared to the superhero media I grew up with like Spider-Man and The Dark Knight. Upon rewatching now, I certainly appreciate the quality of this film for its time. It also can’t be said enough how perfect of a casting that Christopher Reeve is for this role.

I’ll spare some more meta-textual analysis for some of the other films in this series, as well as how I came around to genuinely appreciate Superman as both a hero and a character. I’m really excited to begin this project and can’t wait to see this new production as it hopefully marks the beginning of a new, brave, and bold DC cinematic universe.",,2025-06-11
2025-06-14,How to Train Your Dragon,2025,https://boxd.it/9ZoIl7,2.5,,"I really enjoyed watching this film. I haven't seen the original movie since around the time it was released, so it was nice to jump back into this world. That being said, and not to be a wet blanket, but I can't rate this highly on principle. This movie presents a unique ethical dilemma that other live-action remakes have avoided thus far. While this movie is leagues better than its counterparts, this is nearly a shot-for-shot remake of the original. It's clear there is more love and care for this than other remakes. 

However, I can't help but wonder why this was even made in the first place. At least with other films like this, the filmmakers are forced to change certain aspects of the original to adapt it to live-action, especially in a leap from 2D animation. Watching this film feels as though all the work was already done for them, and all they had to do was slap on realistic textures onto the dragon models that have existed for over a decade. On that note, the original movies aren't even that old. The cynic in me feels like this is some weird tax loophole or royalties scheme to divest viewers away from the original material. Unfortunately, I just can't shake the feeling that this sets a dubious precedent for the rest of the industry.",,2025-06-12

I didn’t always agree with choices that were made in that regard, but I respect the effort to take risks and push the boundaries. This film finds itself in a weird place, and I think it suffers as result. This film is simultaneously the last film of an established trilogy but the first film of what seems to be a new trilogy with these characters. It also didn’t leave a great taste in my mouth that this film seems to be retconning 28 Weeks Later. I understand Danny Boyle didn’t have a hand in that movie, but it was still made with the intention of being a part of this world. The acting is phenomenal, as is the coming-of-age throughline.

2025-07-09,Superman,2025,https://boxd.it/agFcDb,4.5,,"Rest assured, this film is a breath of fresh air. I have some issues with it, but this is probably the best Superman movie out there. I’ve immersed myself in Superman media for the past month, but I still don’t have a definitive picture of what Superman should be to me. I implied in my Superman (1978) review that I didn’t used to like Superman that much. His invulnerability and unwavering character didn’t interest me at the time, but I’ve come to realize those are his greatest strengths. His willingness to do the right thing against all odds serves as a shining beacon of hope amongst the cynicism of the modern age. David Corenswet’s Superman fully embraces this and I really appreciate his portrayal of the character.

My biggest disappointment for me in this film is that there just wasn’t a scene that swept me off my feet—either emotionally or in awe of the heroism. The movie is really well made, but there wasn’t the X-factor that pushes this to be the Superman film I’d been hoping. On top of this, Superman didn’t feel all that super. I empathize with the desire to nerf his power scale compared to previous iterations, especially so we can see him grow throughout these films. However, there needs to be a balance because Superman gets whooped in almost every fight.

The strongest aspect of this film is Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. I’ve always appreciated him as an actor, but he really steals every scene he’s in as Lex. I also loved Mr. Terrific and hope to see more of him moving forward. The great thing about this film is that it has a stronger foundation for the DCU in its first shot than any film made in the DCEU. The sky is truly the limit for this new universe and it’s clear there’s a plan for it that shines through all of this film’s minor details.

2025-07-28,The Fantastic Four: First Steps,2025,https://boxd.it/avnOHz,5,,"Everybody that knows me knows how much I love Marvel. However, people that know me on a deeper level also know how much I’ve been wanting a faithful adaptation of Marvel’s First Family. I’m ecstatic to report that not only is the best representation of the Fantastic Four on the big screen, but sets a rock-solid foundation for the future of the MCU.

The legacy of the Fantastic Four cannot be understated. After comics languished during almost the entirety of the 1950s, the Fantastic Four made their comic debut in 1961 and single-handedly kicked off Marvel’s Silver Age. This book paved the way for creations like Spider-Man, X-Men, and the Avengers to come to fruition at Marvel. It’s easy to forget that, before the MCU, the Fantastic Four were by far Marvel’s most popular team alongside the X-Men for decades. Unfortunately with the film rights being held in an iron grip for over thirty years by Twentieth Century Fox, the Fantastic Four had to sit back and watch as their popularity became eclipsed by Marvel’s B-squads in The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. It got so bad that after the atrocious Fantastic Four film from 2015, the group faded to invisibility and were written out of the comics for almost half a decade.

Throughout the years, I’ve always held out hope that one day the Fantastic Four would be able to come home and interact with the other characters of the Marvel Universe as they have in the comics. At times this hope has been smoldering embers, and there have even been other times where I thought that Marvel would never get the film rights back. On an otherwise ordinary afternoon about six years ago, I read that Disney (and therefore Marvel) had acquired Twentieth Century Fox. In one swift stroke, Marvel had the film rights back for both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. The once smoldering embers of hope burst into a flame of passion that the status of the Fantastic Four will be restored. And then… nothing. After understandable setbacks from both Covid and Hollywood strikes—and perhaps an overextended hand into the Kang Dynasty—these properties are just now breaking ground.

Set in a different universe than our main MCU, Fantastic Four: First Steps takes us to a world where the Fantastic Four are Earth’s only protectors. This movie is a 1960s period piece bolstered by technology that surpasses aspects of our reality, featuring flying cars and teleportation thanks to the leader of the Fantastic Four, Reed Richards. I am a sucker for retrofuturism, so that absolutely added to the appeal of the film for me. It’s no stretch to say that the Fantastic Four’s debut in the public eye marks the turning point that separates this universe from the standard continuity. 

Fantastic Four: First Steps is a triumph of moments in both the big and the small. From the power and intimacy of the internal family dynamics to the cosmic and universal implications of this world, this film truly feels like a comic book come to life. Obviously all of these MCU movies are based on comics, but as a life-long reader this movie at its core is infused with the love and passion for these characters. I knew I would be in for a treat when the opening montage featured the team fighting Giganto, just as they had on their very first comic book cover. Each member of the family has their own moment of glory that highlights their importance for the rest of the team. Ben is shown to be a hometown hero that still is a pillar of his community. Johnny takes the initiative to decipher an alien language. Sue delivers a speech that quells the ire of the entire world. Reed doesn’t rest until he can confidently say that the world is safe from the threat of Galactus. Kind-hearted. Hot-headed. Empath. Devoted. These are all qualities that we’ve seen before in the other Fantastic Four films, but are repurposed and reimagined which I believe to be truer to their comic-book counterparts. 

In terms of the big moments within this film, there is never a dull moment. The pacing is held strongly together by the aforementioned character moments, and each of the larger set pieces are tense and have amazing action. The Herald first arriving on Earth, the confrontation of Galactus and subsequent lightspeed chase, and the team’s final gambit. All of these moments are appropriately given proper weight and accompanied by the memorable score by Michael Giacchino. However, there is one major sequence that perfectly embodies the tone of this film and why it speaks to me so strongly.

Coincidentally, July 2025 features not one but two superhero films of characters that have a long history of less-than-stellar film adaptations and that also serve as a metaphorical crossroads for the future of their respective studios. Just a few weeks ago, Superman soared back onto the big screen and was an amazing first step for the new DCU. I don’t bring up this comparison to tear down the other but to highlight each of the strengths of both films. After a long period of dark and gritty adaptations, Superman is once again the ultimate symbol of hope who is so pure and good-natured that his example sets the precedent for everyone else in the rest of that universe. In Fantastic Four: First Steps, the Fantastic Four quite literally unite the entire world towards the common cause of stopping Galactus. Every single person on the planet puts aside their differences and places their faith and trust within this team to bring them salvation. The weight of the world is placed on the shoulders of the Fantastic Four and they are able to prove to the world that their trust is not misplaced. Superman is the symbol of hope, and the Fantastic Four takes that tangible hope to save the world.

I can easily talk about all of the characters in this film, but I want to briefly highlight the portrayal and characterization of Reed Richards. I will never get tired of seeing Pedro Pascal in movies, but I will admit I was initially hesitant that he could live up to the role of Reed. My fears were allayed by his characterization. Reed is one of the smartest people in the Marvel Universe, to which other adaptations have surely capitalized on this aspect and only this aspect. However, Reed isn’t just a genius because he’s smart, he’s a genius because he’s a worrier. Like Galactus and his unending hunger, Reed has an unending need to eliminate as many rogue variables from both the world and his personal life as possible. It feels like there are a dozen plans that get enacted within this film, but you can tell by Pedro Pascal’s performance that there are countless dozens of more plans cooking within Reed’s mind at any given time. Reed’s mind will never truly be at rest and that is a character-defining trait that is perfectly portrayed in this film.

My only minor disappointment of this film is not getting a proper glimpse of Doctor Doom. There has been much contention of the casting of this role within the MCU, but I am not occupied with that discussion until we can actually see what he looks and sounds like. Doctor Doom is my favorite villain in the entirety of the Marvel Universe. He has definitively never had a good adaptation on screen, which is a shame because Doom done right could easily be one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, I will just have to wait a little bit longer to see this adaptation.

Clearly, I am very passionate about these characters and their addition to the MCU. Going in, I was very nervous about whether or not this would do the Fantastic Four justice, but now I genuinely believe this is one of the best Marvel movies in years. No matter what happens and how the dust settles after Secret Wars, this team finally returns to their once longstanding status as a core pillar of the Marvel Universe. Just like the Fantastic Four were able to do so within the confines of this movie, this film has given me a renewed faith in the future of Marvel and beyonder.",,2025-07-24

This film is almost as egregious as his Oldboy remake, and unfortunately not even Denzel can save this. The editing had me annoyed from the jump, but as it turns out that’s not the worst aspect of this film. For a film about a music record label, the score is extremely boring and uninspired (with the exception of the train scene); the score never matches the tone of the scene it’s trying to convey. It also completely drops the ball on the entire crime thriller aspect. There’s simply no investigative work done at all, which was such a draw of the original. Every scene is such a weak translation of the original but with literally all of the context and meaning removed. There’s no tension and there’s no consequences.

This movie excels in its lack of restraint, not just because of its finality but also because everyone’s breathing styles and powers are pushed to their absolute limit.

Believe the hype because this is one of the most well-crafted and politically relevant films of the last five years—what Eddington wishes it could be. From the very first scene, I could feel a lot of the anger about the current state of affairs in our country. Even ignoring the politics, there's just something so satisfying about the way this world is constructed. There are definitely many hyperbolic elements of the way this story is told, but ultimately that is to serve the underlying themes. I was most intrigued by the way this film portrays the Klan and how there is a sanitization of evil that has permeated our country. There's so much to unpack about this movie and I'm sure it would benefit from multiple viewings. Benicio del Toro delivers a new favorite character performance, and Sean Penn absolutely melts into this role. Also, the camerawork at the end of the film is truly exhilarating.

It didn’t help that the beginning made the movie feel like it would insist upon itself. That said, this film exceeded my expectations and had some nice moments throughout. I really liked the second part the most, and that isn’t just because I’m biased towards Cate Blanchett, although I did think she gave a unique performance in this movie. I’m normally one to look past product placement in movies, but the Rolex features in this felt somewhat slimy considering Rolex is one of the main sponsors of NYFF. I know this movie wasn’t made explicitly for this festival, but it also didn’t feel like these moments added anything thematically to the film besides providing weak connective tissue between the three stories.

It’s refreshing to see a concerted effort to elevate his craft, and I hope to see more like this out of The Rock in the future.

2025-10-13,No Other Choice,2025,https://boxd.it/blBJ3Z,4,,"I stood and waited six hours in line to see this because, well, I had no other choice. 

This has been one of my most anticipated movies since its announcement. This film features the reunion of director Park Chan-wook and actor Lee Byung-hun, who previously worked together twenty-five years ago on one of my favorite films, Joint Security Area. The main appeal of seeing this film during NYFF, other than getting to see it more than two months before general audiences, was that both Park and Lee were here as a part of a Q&A hosted by the NYFF. I knew I had to see this film but, without trying to be dramatic, attending this screening would test my willpower and resolve.

When the NYFF tickets went on sale, the screenings for this film were instantly sold out. The only option I had was to use the standby line with no guarantee that I would even be able to get into the screening. This would mean that I would have to wait in line for multiple hours for just a chance to see this film. On the day of, I mentally and physically prepare to enter the gauntlet. I threw on four layers of clothes (since of course this weekend decided to be one of the first cold weekends of the year), I slammed a twenty-piece Chicken McNugget (since I was unsure if I would be able to eat dinner, and I minimized my fluid intake (since I didn’t want to have to go to the bathroom). I arrived at the theater around 3:15pm and the screening time was 9:15pm. Luckily, I happened to be the first person in line and, as this review implies, my mission was successful in getting to see this film.

As for the film itself, No Other Choice is a critique on the lengths we will go in order to stay employed. I deeply empathize with Yoo Man-soo’s initial struggle of being unable to find employment and I can’t even imagine what that would be like with the additional responsibility of having a family to take care of on top of that. As we go deeper into Yoo’s commitment, we find the continually binding mantra this film gets its namesake from: that Yoo is left with no other choice.

I think the main aspect that is holding me back from truly loving this film is that I feel it is unrealistic, even if it is meant to be hyperbolic. I’ve felt that Park Chan-wook’s films for the most part have always maintained a sense of realism underlining them. I would’ve liked to see Yoo Man-soo find a way to break the feedback loop of a journey that he set himself upon. On an unrelated note, I really enjoyed the camera work and especially the transitions in this film. It shows that Park Chan-wook has still got it and is continuing to find ways to tell his stories in an interesting and engaging way.

At the end of the film as the credits rolled, Park Chan-wook and Lee Byung-hun sat down for a moderated Q&A and that alone is already one of my favorite film experiences I’ve had the pleasure of attending. I got to learn about the lengthy process it took to get this film made from Park and how he wasn’t even planning on having it be set in Korea for a while. I also gained insight into some of the choices Lee made for his character and how he was surprised with the slapstick nature of his character compared to his other films. I’m really glad I put in the effort to see this film when I did, and getting to be in the presence of an actor and director whose bodies of work I really enjoy was the highlight of my NYFF63 experience.",,2025-10-09

I feel like Arnett’s best known roles are either from TV or are animated voice-over roles which isn’t a problem, but this film made me realize how strong he could be on film. I solidly thought that I might be too young for the target demographic of this movie considering it’s a dramedy revolving around divorcees of a twenty-year marriage.

Disappointingly, this is also the case for Bugonia in relation to its original, Save the Green Planet. In general, I do believe there can be merit in remaking a film, whether it be to update it for modern times or to adapt it to a different global audience. Bugonia is doing both: modernizing the time period while also translating it from a Korean cultural perspective to an American one.

Before seeing this film, I felt Bugonia was poised to uniquely capture the current social and political landscape. I’ve seen the original and I believed there could definitely be something new to added to the conversation prompted by it. Unfortunately, it does just feel like a beat-for-beat remake of the original, even with its messaging. I actually did feel that Save the Green Planet conveyed a lot of its plot points better than this film, especially the ending.

I think this film was still enjoyable. As expected, the acting was great and Yorgos’s iconic artistic vision definitely shone through. This film is worth watching if you haven’t seen the original, and I’m glad this film is going to expose new audiences to this story.

This film is about the weight of the relationships we carry amongst our family, friends, and acquaintances, but I also felt an underlying message regarding navigating life’s most impossible choices.
